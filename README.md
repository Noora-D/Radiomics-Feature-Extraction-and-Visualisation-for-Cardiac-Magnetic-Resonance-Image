# Radiomics-Feature-Extraction-and-Visualisation-for-Cardiac-Magnetic-Resonance-Image
This project aims to provide a convenient and integrated tool for clinical analysis, enabling 3D visualisation of raw Cardiac MRI, as well as extraction of radiomics features and visualisation of voxel-based feature maps of different ROIs in combination with image segmentation results, providing a strong basis for clinical diagnosis and research.
